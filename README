Windows Driver Installer library for libusb (libusb-wdi)

Features:
- Automated driverless device detection
- Automated inf creation, using the name reported by the USB device
- Automated driver files extraction, for both 32 and 64 bit platforms
- Automated driver installation, including UAC elevation where necessary
- When statically linked, only the final executable needs to be redistributed to
  ensure that a driver can be automatically installed on any Windows platform.


Note, for the reditributale library to work on both 64 and 32 bit, you must
compile both the 32 and 64 bit version of the installer executable before you
build the library. If you use gcc, you must ensure that your compiler supports
*BOTH* -m32 and -m64

Compiling:
Regardless of your development environment, you must either have the Windows DDK
installed, or have the winusb/wdf 32 and 64 bit redistributable DLLs.
You must edit the file config.h (msvc/config.h for MSVC) to set DDK_PATH path.

Example:
setdvr is a sample that uses libusb-wdi to detect all driverless USB devices on
your system and automatically install a WinUSB driver for them.
