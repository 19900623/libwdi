Windows Driver Installer library for libusb (libusb-wdi)

Features:
- Automated driverless device detection
- Automated inf creation, using the name reported by the USB device
- Automated driver files extraction, for both 32 and 64 bit platforms
- Automated driver installation, including UAC elevation where necessary
- When statically linked, only the final executable needs to be redistributed to
  ensure that a driver can be automatically installed on any Windows platform.


Note, for the reditributale library to work on both 64 and 32 bit, you must
compile both the 32 and 64 bit version of the installer executable before you
build the library. ***ALPHA - only works with MSVC for now***

Compiling: ***ALPHA - this WILL be improved***
Regardless of your development environment, you must either have the Windows DDK
installed, or have the winusb/wdf 32 and 64 bit redistributable DLLs.
You also need to have libusb (from libusb-pbatard) already compiled with the
same environment as the one you plan to use to compile libusb-wdi
Then you must edit the file embedder/embedder.c to set DDK_PATH path and, if
necessary, edit the various Makefile.am to set the path to the libusb library.

Example:
setdvr is a sample that uses libusb-wdi to detect all driverless USB devices on
your system and automatically install a WinUSB driver for them.
